						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> What I learned from this article is that when I make an animation for a website I need to make sure to take into consideration that the animation is slow enough to notice the difference. If I make animations that are too fast it would've been simpler for it to have no animation. It is better for the animation to serve a purpose than to over animate something for no reason. Something that I will definitely keep in mind is that animation durations should usally only take 200-300ms.</p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was the different motions that were talked about. There is easing to make sure that the movement of the objects are more natural than clunky. It's also fascinating how we have to take into account linear motion and acceleration curve in order to more naturally mimic reality. Transoformations from the real world to a 2D representation is pretty fascinating topic that reminds me of linear algrebra.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> If the animation is built correctly, then it is unobtrusive and does not distract the users from their goals. If it does, you either need to soften it or even remove at all. That means that the animation shouldn't slow down the user or prevent from performing the task. </p>
