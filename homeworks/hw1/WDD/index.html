            Hi! My name is Abraham Viteri and I come from SoCal. 
            I like to watch movies at the theatre, listen to my vinyls/go to 
            the record store, and play video games. If I'm not doing any of those things
            I'm probably at the gym. Excited to be apart of this decal and look forward to
            a good semester!

            <li>One thing I learned from this article was how to study apps. Since
                I will be focused on developing websites I need to now study their 
            design so I can implement them on my own. I need to look out for the Hierarchy, Conent, Intent
            Audience of whatever website/app I'm using</li>
            <li>My favorite part of the article was when the author broke down the app into
                it's smaller components. Seeing the apps broken down that like gives you a sense
                of what goes into the app/website and how each piece is designed with a purpose.
            </li>
            <li>A quote I found interesting was 'By routinely analyzing other apps, you will
                 develop your product thinking and get better at designing apps yourself.'</li>
