							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Color accessibility enables people with visual impairments or color visions deficiencies to interact with digital experiences in the same way as their non-visually-impared counterparts. We have roughly 217 million people with some form of vision impairment in the world. I learned that is could be seen as rude to not create products that are accessible to everyone. I also learned about the 4:5:1 ratio which is the background-to-text contrast ratio which is important when designing buttons and other things that navigate the website.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was how it made me more aware of the different types of people that could be accessing my website. I hadn't really thought about accessibility but it is important to make everyone feel included when designing a website. Learning about how choices can affect people was very important to me.  </p>
