						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I learned about in the late 2000s there was a huge wave of LinkedIn spam in email inboxes with a lot of follow up emails that asked to enroll into their services. This malpractice was eventually caught by the government since it was very hard to opt out. This was simply because of the the design choice which made it hard to opt out and goes back to dark pattern design for websites.  </p>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of the article was learning about the different types of dark patterns on the website. There are patterns such as Bait and Switch, Hidden Costs, Misdirection, and Privacy Zuckering. Most of these designs are somewhat misleading and malpractice which are intended to force a certain action on users by tricking them or misleading them. Understanding why to stay away from some of these designs is important and noticing them on other websites could be helpful too.  </p>
