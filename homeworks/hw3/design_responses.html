						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> One of the things I learned is that typography can make or break a design. I also learned that good design
								aligns its typography with its purpose by setting the mood, tone, and style in the designs 
								make. I also learned that when you choose a type of font we need to keep these principles in mind:
								readability, legibility, and purpose. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part about this article was the technical part where you have to determine what 
								font sizes you should pick. I think I am usually pretty bad at picking fonts, especially in my 
								previous work when I edited videos for fun. The golden ratio is something that I can keep in the
								in the back of my mind when I need to choose a good size. Picking the most pleasing ratios will 
								most likely help the websites we design.  </p>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
