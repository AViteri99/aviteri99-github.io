							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>There are a couple of things I learned from this article. The first thing is that padding(whitespace) can be an 
								effective tool to ensure consistency and easy maintenance across any site. It also serves to
								maitain user focus, visual organization, and increased readability. Using padding effectively
								can ensure that your website delivers on its intended goal.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>My favorite part about the article was seeing the different designs for wayfiar. It shows two
								examples of what to do and not to do and it's interesting seeing the different design process.
								Things that I usually don't pick up on when I'm on a website are now being displayed and I can notice
								the different tactics websites are using to help me as the consumer.
