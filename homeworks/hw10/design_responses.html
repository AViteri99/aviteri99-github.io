							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p> It is interesting learning about the different stages of information processing even though some of the issues are still debated. It did influence my opinion because I hadn't taken into account attention/attention span as a limited cognitive resource. Althought I can't really contend with the points being brought up because of my limited knowledge of psychology, I can agree that as time goes on our attention descreases. Hick's Law is also something that I feel like I experience but haven't thought aobut in the moment so I would agree on what the article offers. A good example that is told in the article is divided attention which states that if a process is automatic then more processes can occur at the same time. This is like driving and talking at the same time and when an accident or something happens on the road the person stops talking and focuses on what's going on.  </p>
