                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> What I learned from this article was that there are infinitely many design choices that can be made for a website and each choice should be made thoroughly. Each page has a different purpose and there are many things that you could change in order to satisfy your goals. I also see that the animations are pretty wild so knowing what is possible when developing is very interesting. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of the article were different layouts for the different pages. It is interesting viewing these pages from a design review perspective as I was used to being only a consumer. Knowing that you can make anything to fit your brand is super cool. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite inspiration was the crypto wallet transaction confirmation. This is because when we think of crypto we think of some futuristic monetary system where everything is digital and advanced. When I see the wallet and the payment transfer it looks futuristic and almost space like. This also ties in with all the crypto coins going to the moon! Mostly all crypto design choices are catered to futuristic scifi design patterns.  </p>
