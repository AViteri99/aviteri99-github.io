							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that visual design and psychology are linked and can influence one another. I also learned about Proximity which means that elements arranged close to each other are perceived as more related than those place further apart. I learned that we need to use the Proximity principle in UI design for grouping similar information. This principle states that elements placed within the same region are perceived as grouped.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was the conclusion where we learn about user interface design isn't about cool graphics. It's about performance and communication. I also really liked the different principles that are explored as there are so many when it comes to spacing and grouping.   </p>
